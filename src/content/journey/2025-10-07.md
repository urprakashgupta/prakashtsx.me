_3:30 AM. Six hours deep into code. And it's finally alive._

## What I Did Today

Today wasn't just another day. Today was **Day 1** of my journey. The day I decided to stop planning and start **building**.

For the past 6 hours, I've been in the zone â€” fixing bugs, tweaking styles, pushing commits, and watching my website come to life. It's 3:15 AM now, and I'm not tired. I'm **alive**.

### Highlights

- âœ… Built and deployed **prakashtsx.me** from scratch
- âœ… Set up Daily Diary and Tech Blog sections
- âœ… Connected my custom domain
- âœ… Fought with ESLint errors and won
- âœ… Made countless commits, each one a step forward
- âœ… Turned an idea into reality in one sitting

## What I Learned

**Building is hard. But finishing is harder.**

## Thoughts & Reflections

I've had this idea for so long â€” a place to document my journey, share what I learn, and track my growth. But I kept waiting for the "perfect time" or the "right moment."

**Tonight, I realized something:** There is no perfect time. There's only now.

So I sat down, opened my editor, and started coding. One component at a time. One fix at a time. One commit at a time.

And now? **It's live.** My website. My domain. My space on the internet.

This isn't just a website. It's a commitment. A promise to myself that I'll show up every day, document my journey, and keep building â€” no matter how small the progress.

## The Emotion Behind It

I won't lie â€” there were moments tonight when I wanted to give up. When the build failed for the 5th time. When ESLint threw errors I didn't understand. When I couldn't figure out why markdown wasn't rendering properly.

But I didn't quit.

Because this matters. **I matter.**

Every developer starts somewhere. Tonight was my somewhere. Tomorrow, I'll be one step further.

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning. Tomorrow (or later today, technically), I'll:

- Write my first technical blog post
- Continue learning and building
- Keep this daily diary streak alive
- Push myself beyond comfort zones

## A Note to Future Me

If you're reading this weeks, months, or years from now â€” remember this night.

Remember how it felt to build something from nothing. Remember the 3 AM exhaustion that felt like pure joy. Remember why you started.

**You built this. You can build anything.**

**"Code, Learn, Document, Repeat"**

Tonight, I coded. Tonight, I learned. Tonight, I documented.

Tomorrow, I repeat.
